# Shoot a Rama 2k17

A remake of my first program/game that I originally wrote in QBasic back in June 1995.  While all versions through Shoot a Rama 2000 only had 2 or 3 turns and then ended, this version turns the player's role into that of the GM of a Team.   Each team is randomized each game to create a near infinite amount of games.

Using SQLite and Xamarin Forms with C# targeting iOS, UWP and Android platforms.
